				<h2> DATA CHALLENGE </h2>
				<h3 class="text-left"> <b>1. Distribution of the visit durations: </b> Most visitors go to malls G and S for about an hour, but the distributions are quite different. Figure 1 shows both density distributions, normed in order to facilitate the comparison.</h3>

		<h3 class="text-left"> The distributions for malls G and S appear to be log-normal and right-skewed with medians <b>1.13</b> and <b>1.61</b> and means <b>1.40</b> and <b>1.90</b>, respectively, showing that most users spend about an hour at the mall. However, the standard deviation and inter-quantile-range (IQR) of visit durations for Mall S is  broader than for Mall G, indicating that <b>there is a larger fraction of users that stay at Mall S longer</b>. The difference is more clearly seen after a visit duration of 2 hrs, where the number of visits drops sharply for Mall G but falls off slowly for Mall S. 
		</h3>

<h3 class="text-left"> Figure 2 (below) shows more clearly the breath of IQR in both distributions, and the 3-sigma outliers. The narrow IQR and long tail of the data for Mall G show that most visitors go there to carry out quick tasks lasting between <b>0.5</b> to <b>2 hrs</b>, whereas visitors that go to Mall S are more likely to stay longer. In fact, visitors that stay at Mall G for <b>4 hrs</b> or longer are 3-sigma outliers, while outliers at mall S stay for <b>5.5 hrs</b> or longer. We'll take another look at these "outliers" when we develop a model for finding employees. </h3>

			 <h3 class="text-left">  <a href="{{ url_for('beyond') }}">Later</a>, we will see that most users go to Mall S preferrably at meal times (lunch and dinner), which may help explain why users that go to this mall stay longer.

		<h3 class="text-left"> <b>2. Distribution of the number of events: </b> The number of events varies quite wildly among the traces. Figure 3 below shows an extremely right-skewed distribution </h3>

		<h3 class="text-left"> The mode of each distribution shows that most traces contain <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> events at Malls G and S, respectively. Again, as with the distribution of the visit durations, the distribution of Mall G is highly peaked and rapidly declining, with narrow standard deviation and IQR. Instead, the distribution for Mall S is broader and the likelihood of having over 20 events is much higher.  </h3> 
		<h3 class="text-left"> Because both distributions are strongly dominated by the high-event-number-tail, a boxplot is more appropiate to take a look at these 3-sigma outliers.</h3>

			<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 4:</b> Boxplots whosing the distribution of the number of events and basic statistics for Mall G and Mall S, </br> using individual traces. Outliers are more clearly seen in each case.</p>

		<h3 class="text-left"> While the bulk of the user population receives only between <b> 2</b> and <b>10</b> events, but a handful of traces contain over <b>200</b> events for Mall G and over <b>600</b> events at mall S! </h3> 
		 
		<h3 class="text-left"> Because more traces can be collected over a longer period of time, it is possible to especulate that there could be a positive correlation between visit duration and number of events. Support from this hypothesis comes from the fact that in general, more events are generated by users at Mall S, where users tend to stay longer. We take a look at that next. </h3>

			<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 5:</b> Scatter plot of the visit duration vs. the number of events per trace for Mall G and Mall S.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="text-left"> In fact, there is no obvious correlation between the visit duration and the number of events in a single trace. In mall G the trend seems to be opposite: visits of over four hours have generally fewer events. In Mall S we see the maximun number of event rising until the visit duration reaches about 4 hrs. After that, the number of events declines. </h3>
		 
		<h3 class="text-left"> Another possibility is that the the number of events correlates with the time of the day at which the user goes to the mall. To do this, we approximate the time as the start of the trace. Figure 6 below shows this trend. </h3>

			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="text-left"> Interestingly, there seems to be certain peaks at which traces that contain many events occur during the day, particularly in the morning and at mid-day, and towards 8pm for Mall S. <a href="{{ url_for('beyond') }}">Later</a> we will see that this may be due to the fact that there is a pattern of when people go to each mall during the day. </h3>
