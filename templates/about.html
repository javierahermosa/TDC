				<h2> Further Insights</h2>
				
				<h3 class="text-left"> The data is quite rich, and </h3>
				
				<h3 class="text-left"> 1. What's the size of the dataset? We have cell phone traces associated with two malls. There are <b>9,195</b> traces for Mall G and <b>50,294</b> traces from Mall S collected over a period of two weeks, from Jan 13th - Jan 26th, 2014. </h3>
				
				<h3 class="text-left"> 2. How many unique users are there? The Mall G and Mall S datasets have <b>5,959</b> and <b>33,797</b> unique users, respectively.</h3>
					
				<h3 class="text-left"> 3. What fraction of  users visit the malls only once in the two-week period? Most users visit the malls just once. Mall G and Mall S received a total of <b>85%</b> and <b>76.8%</b> unique visits, respectively (see figure below). </h3>

				<h3 class="text-left">  4. How much time do visitors spend at the mall? The median visit duration for Malls G and S are <b>1.1 hrs</b> and <b>1.6 hrs</b>, respectively. The average for Malls G and S is <b>1.4 hrs</b> and <b>1.9 hrs</b>. Because the mean is more strongly affected by outliers, we expect to see a right-skewed distribution of visit durations in both malls. </h3>
				
				<h3 class="text-left"> 5. How many events per trace are most typical? Between <b>2</b> and <b>10</b> events. In rare cases, traces have over <b>100</b> events.  </h3>
						
				<h3 class="text-left"> 6. Are there any users that visit both Malls? The users at Mall G and Mall S are different and must be treated independently. Even though <b> 418 </b> user IDs are present in both datasets, their residency zip codes don't match, and therefore we can't assume a connection between them. </h3>

				<h3 class="text-left"> Indeed, Mall S has more clients on Saturday, but that that's not the case for Mall G. There, as many users visit the mall on Satuday as on any other day of the week, roughly speaking. </h3>

				<h3 class="text-left"> The data for mall G is smaller, we only have traces for one cell phone company. It's possible that the service is better in the area of the mall for this company. </h3>
