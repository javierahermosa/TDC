<h3 class="text-left">  4. How often do frequent visitors go to the mall? In Mall S, <b>64.2%</b> of frequent visitors appear at the mall exactly twice. In Mall G, only <b>47.9%</b> of frequent users are at the mall exactly twice, so users are nearly equally likely to go to mall G twice or more frequently. But some users visited the mall quite often in the two-week period: <b>74</b> users appeared at mall G over 10 times, while  <b>236</b> do so at mall S. This could be a hint into who works at each mall.  </h3>
