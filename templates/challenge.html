				<h2> DATA CHALLENGE </h2>
				<h3 class="text-left"> <b>1. Distribution of the visit durations: </b> Most visitors go to malls G and S for about an hour, but the distributions are quite different. Figure 1 shows both density distributions, normed in order to facilitate the comparison.</h3>

				<div class="col-lg-12">

					<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 1:</b> Distribution of visit durations and basic statistics for Mall G and Mall S, using individual traces. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
			
		<h3 class="text-left"> The distributions for malls G and S appear to be log-normal and right-skewed with medians <b>1.13</b> and <b>1.61</b> and means <b>1.40</b> and <b>1.90</b>, respectively, showing that most users spend about an hour at the mall. However, the standard deviation and inter-quantile-range (IQR) of visit durations for Mall S is  broader than for Mall G, indicating that <b>there is a larger fraction of users that stay at Mall S longer</b>. The difference is more clearly seen after a visit duration of 2 hrs, where the number of visits drops sharply for Mall G but falls off slowly for Mall S. 
		</h3>

<h3 class="text-left"> Figure 2 (below) shows more clearly the breath of IQR in both distributions, and the 3-sigma outliers. The narrow IQR and long tail of the data for Mall G show that most visitors go there to carry out quick tasks lasting between <b>0.5</b> to <b>2 hrs</b>, whereas visitors that go to Mall S are more likely to stay longer. In fact, visitors that stay at Mall G for <b>4 hrs</b> or longer are 3-sigma outliers, while outliers at mall S stay for <b>5.5 hrs</b> or longer. We'll take another look at these "outliers" when we develop a model for finding employees. </h3>

			</div>
		</div>
		
			 <h3 class="text-left">  <a href="{{ url_for('beyond') }}">Later</a>, we will see that most users go to Mall S preferrably at meal times (lunch and dinner), which may help explain why users that go to this mall stay longer.		 
		</h3>
		<h3 class="text-left"> <b>2. Distribution of the number of events: </b> The number of events varies quite wildly among the traces. Figure 3 below shows an extremely right-skewed distribution </h3>

			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<div>
				<a href="#"><img class="img-rounded" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/event_distrib.png') }}" alt="" height="580" width="auto"></a>
				<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 3:</b> Distribution of the number of events and basic statistics for Mall G and Mall S, using individual traces. </br>The kernel density is shown as solid lines.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		
		<h3 class="text-left"> The mode of each distribution shows that most traces contain <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> events at Malls G and S, respectively. Again, as with the distribution of the visit durations, the distribution of Mall G is highly peaked and rapidly declining, with narrow standard deviation and IQR. Instead, the distribution for Mall S is broader and the likelihood of having over 20 events is much higher.  </h3> 
		<h3 class="text-left"> Because both distributions are strongly dominated by the high-event-number-tail, a boxplot is more appropiate to take a look at these 3-sigma outliers.</h3>

			<div>
			<a href="#"><img class="img-rounded" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/events_boxplots.png') }}" alt="" height="580" width="auto"></a>
			<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 4:</b> Boxplots whosing the distribution of the number of events and basic statistics for Mall G and Mall S, </br> using individual traces. Outliers are more clearly seen in each case.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	
		<h3 class="text-left"> The bulk of the user population has only between <b> 2</b> and <b>10</b> events per trace, but a handful of traces contain over <b>200</b> events for Mall G and over <b>600</b> events at mall S! </h3> 
		 
		<h3 class="text-left"> Because more traces can be collected over a longer period of time, it is possible to especulate that there should be a positive correlation between visit duration and number of events. Support from this hypothesis comes from the fact that in general, more events are generated by users at Mall S, where users tend to stay longer. We take a look at that next. </h3>

		<div class="col-lg-12">

			<a href="#"><img class="img-rounded" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/event_vs_duration.png') }}" alt="" height="580" width="auto"></a>
			<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 5:</b> Scatter plot of the visit duration vs. the number of events per trace for Mall G and Mall S.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="text-left"> As we see in Figure 5, there is no obvious correlation between the visit duration and the number of events in a single trace. In mall G the trend seems to be opposite: visits of over four hours have generally fewer events. In Mall S we see the maximun number of event rising until the visit duration reaches about 4 hrs. After that, the number of events declines. </h3>
		 
		<h3 class="text-left"> Another possibility is that the the number of events correlates with the time of the day at which the user goes to the mall. To do this, we approximate the time as the start of the trace. Figure 6 below shows this trend. </h3> 
		
		<br>
		<div class="col-lg-12">

			<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 6:</b> Plot of the number of events per hour at times when users goes to the mall.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="text-left"> Interestingly, the distribution of the number events throughout the day is not uniform. The distribution peaks at lunch time (around 12 noon) for Mall G and is bimodal for Mall S, with peaks at lunch time and dinner time (at around 12 noon and 6 pm). The reason for this, as we will see  <a href="{{ url_for('beyond') }}">later</a>, is that most people go to the malls at these times.  </h3> 
		
		<h3 class="text-left"> <b>3. A. Percentage of unique visitors per day:</b> We define the percentage of unique visitors per day as the number of users who visit the mall once a day divided by the total number of users who visited the mall that day. Note that the total is not the total number of traces per day but the total number of unique ids per day. First, let's look at the average number of unique visitors per day at Malls G and S: </h3>

		</div>
			<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 7:</b> Average percentage of unique 					visitors per day, including rare Sunday visits, for Mall G and Mall S. </p>
	
		<h3 class="text-left"> We find that <b>89.2%</b> of users at Mall G and <b>90.0%</b> of users at Mall S visit each mall once per day, and therefore only about <b>10%</b> of users visit the mall more often. In calculating this average, we included the unique visits on Sundays, but we focus only on work days we find a small decrease in the percentage of unique visitors, to <b>88.2%</b> for Mall G and  <b>88.9%</b> for mall S.  It is actually surprising that roughly <b>10%</b> of users return to the mall on a single day. Many of these users may be employees of the mall.  </h3>
			
			<h3 class="text-left"> As we found  <a href="{{ url_for('basics') }}">earlier</a>, there is a smaller number of unique visitors per day than unique visitors over the entire two-week period. This is because many users return to the malls over a time span of two-weeks, but very few have several traces on one day.</h3>
		
			<h3 class="text-left"> It can be instructive to look at the percentage of unique visits for each day individually. This is shown in Figure 8 below.</h3>
		
			<br>
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<div>
				<a href="#"><img class="img-rounded" 
				src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/percent_unique.png') }}" 				 onmouseover="this.src='../static/img/percent_unique2.png'" 	  				  onmouseout="this.src='../static/img/percent_unique.png'" 
				alt="" height="580" width="auto"></a>
				
				<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 8:</b> Percentage of unique 					visitors per day. Hoover over the image to see markers </p>
				</div>
			</div>
	
				<h3 class="text-left"> The percentage of unique visitors varies from day to day. What is interesting is that Mall G receives more unique visitors on Saturday than Mall S, with a <b>10%</b> increase from the average working day. More data (over a longer period of time) would help determine whether the increase in unique visitors is significant. If true, then users are more likely to return to the mall on weekdays. Possible explanations for this are that more employees work on weekdays than on Saturdays, or that many users have both lunch and dinner at the mall. We will take a closer look at these alternatives later. </h3>
			
			<h3 class="text-left"> <b>3. B. Percentage of unique visitors per week:</b> We define the percentage of unique visitors per week as the fraction of users that went to the mall once. Again, the total number of users is the number of unique visitor IDs in a week, not the total number of traces. The average percetages of unique visitors for Mall G and Mall S are shown below: </h3> 

				<br>
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<div>
					<a href="#"><img class="img-rounded" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/pie_visitors_MallG_per_week.png') }}" alt="" height="342" width="auto"></a>

					<!-- <div class="tilt"> -->
					<a href="#"><img class="img-rounded" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/pie_visitors_MallS_per_week.png') }}" alt="" height="342" width="auto"></a>
					<!-- </div> -->
				</div>
					<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 9:</b> Average percentage of unique visitors per week, for Mall G and Mall S. </p>
			<h3 class="text-left"> The number of unique visits is now <b>85.2%</b> of mall G and <b>81.9%</b> for Mall S, larger than for unique daily visits. This makes sence, since users are more likely to return to the mall on a weekly basis rather than on a daily basis. The number of unique visits doesn't vary significantly from week 1 to week 2. In both malls, this difference is about <b>1%</b>. </h3>
			
			<h3 class="text-left"> <b>3. C. Frequency of visits for users that return to the mall each day:</b>  Now, we look at how many visitors appear at the mall twice a day or more frequenlty. </h3>
			
			
			<br>
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<div>
				<a href="#"><img class="img-rounded" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/frequency_visits_day.png') }}" alt="" height="580" width="auto"></a>
				<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 10: Frequency of visits per day for Malls G and S.</b> </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h3 class="text-left"> Most frequent visitors appear at the mall twice a day, but a larger fraction of users go to Mall G more frequently that frequent visitors of Mall S. The frequency of visits in a single day declines exponentially, with only a handful of users going to the mall over 6 times and none over 7 times. </h3>
			
			<h3 class="text-left"> <b>3. D. Frequency of visits for users that return to the mall each week:</b> It is also interesting to see how many times users go to the mall in a week. Figure 11 shows normalized histograms comparing the frequent visits at Mall G and S:</h3> 
			
			<br>
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<div>
				<a href="#"><img class="img-rounded" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/frequency_visits_week.png') }}" alt="" height="580" width="auto"></a>
				<p class="text-center"> <b>Figure 11: Frequency of visits per week for Malls G and S.</b> </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h3 class="text-left"> In this case, the decline in frequency of the visits is also exponential, with most frequent users visiting the malls twice a week. As we saw on Figure 10, visitors can appear at the mall more than once per day, which explains why some weekly visitors are seen at the mall over 10 times per week. </h3>
